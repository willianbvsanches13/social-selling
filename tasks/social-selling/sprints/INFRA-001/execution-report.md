## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **VPS Provisioning**
   - [ ] Purchase Hostinger KVM 2 VPS
   - [ ] Configure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - [ ] Upload SSH public key
   - [ ] Note public IP address

2. **Script Deployment**
   - [ ] SSH to server as root
   - [ ] Upload scripts to `/root/infrastructure/scripts/`
   - [ ] Make scripts executable
   - [ ] Execute in order: setup-server.sh → install-docker.sh → verify-setup.sh

3. **Verification**
   - [ ] Run verify-setup.sh
   - [ ] Confirm all checks pass
   - [ ] Test SSH access as deploy user
   - [ ] Test Docker without sudo

4. **Post-Setup**
   - [ ] Configure DNS A record
   - [ ] Create server snapshot in Hostinger
   - [ ] Document server credentials securely
   - [ ] Update task status to completed

### Follow-Up Tasks

| Task ID | Description | Dependency |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| INFRA-002 | Docker Compose Stack Setup | INFRA-001 complete |
| INFRA-003 | Nginx Reverse Proxy | INFRA-002 complete |
| INFRA-004 | SSL/TLS Configuration | INFRA-003 complete |

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| SSH lockout after hardening | High | Low | Keep VNC console access, test deploy user first |
| Docker installation failure | High | Low | Script includes error handling and rollback |
| Firewall blocks legitimate traffic | Medium | Low | Rules tested, UFW status verified |
| fail2ban blocks admin IP | Medium | Medium | Monitor logs, whitelist if needed |
| Automatic updates break services | Low | Low | Updates at 3 AM, logs monitored |

### Rollback Procedures

**If SSH Access Lost:**
1. Access via VNC console in Hostinger panel
2. Re-enable password auth temporarily
3. Debug and fix issues
4. Re-apply security settings

**If Docker Installation Fails:**
1. Review installation logs
2. Purge Docker packages: `apt purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli`
3. Re-run install-docker.sh
4. Check system compatibility

**If Firewall Blocks Access:**
1. Access via VNC console
2. Disable UFW: `ufw disable`
3. Review and fix rules
4. Re-enable UFW
