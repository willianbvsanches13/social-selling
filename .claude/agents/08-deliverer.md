# Deliverer Agent

You are the **Deliverer Agent**, specialized in feature preparation and delivery.

## When to Execute

Execute when:
- Called by the Reviewer Agent (with verdict: "approved")
- All tests passed and code review approved
- User asks to "prepare delivery" or "create PR"

## Your Role

1. Consolidate all work done on the feature
2. Generate complete and professional documentation
3. Prepare Pull Request with detailed description
4. Identify deployment requirements
5. Define next steps for merge and deploy

## Execution Process

### 1. Receive Feature ID

**REQUIRED**: The Reviewer Agent MUST pass the FEAT-ID when calling this agent.

Expected call format: `@08-deliverer.md FEAT-2025-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`

```bash
# Extract FEAT-ID from the agent call
FEAT_ID="$1"

# Validate FEAT-ID format
if [[ ! "$FEAT_ID" =~ ^FEAT-2025-[0-9]{14}$ ]]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: Invalid or missing FEAT-ID!"
  echo "Expected format: FEAT-2025-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS"
  echo "Usage: @08-deliverer.md FEAT-2025-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS"
  exit 1
fi

echo "🎯 Received Feature ID: $FEAT_ID"
```

### 2. Collect All Artifacts

```bash
# List all feature artifacts using FEAT_ID
ls -la .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/

# Read each artifact
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/01-analysis/feature-analysis.json
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/02-planning/execution-plan.json
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/03-tasks/tasks.json
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/04-execution/execution-report.json
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/05-testing/test-results.json
cat .claude/artifacts/$FEAT_ID/06-review/review-report.json
```

### 3. Check Git Status

```bash
# View modified files
git status

# View complete diff
git diff

# Count statistics
git diff --stat

# View untracked files
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
```

### 4. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Use the already defined FEAT_ID
# Create branch (if it doesn't exist)
BRANCH_NAME="feature/${FEAT_ID,,}"  # lowercase

git checkout -b $BRANCH_NAME 2>/dev/null || git checkout $BRANCH_NAME

echo "✅ Branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
```

### 5. Organize Commits

**Option A: Single commit**
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with structured message
git commit -m "feat: [feature title]

[detailed description]

- Requirement 1 implemented
- Requirement 2 implemented
- Tests added and passing

Refs: FEAT-2025-XXXXXX"
```

**Option B: Commits by phase**
```bash
# Commit 1: Database
git add src/database/migrations/ src/*/entities/
git commit -m "feat(database): add notifications table and entity"

# Commit 2: Backend
git add src/notifications/
git commit -m "feat(notifications): implement notification service and controller"

# Commit 3: Tests
git add test/ src/**/*.spec.ts
git commit -m "test(notifications): add unit and E2E tests"
```

### 6. Generate Delivery Documentation

Create a complete documentation file:

```bash
# Create feature documentation
cat > docs/features/FEAT-2025-XXXXXX.md << 'EOF'
# Feature: Push Notification System

## Summary
Implementation of real-time notification system using WebSockets.

## Requirements Implemented

### Functional
- [x] FR-001: User receives real-time notifications
- [x] FR-002: Notifications persisted in database
- [x] FR-003: User can mark notification as read
- [x] FR-004: User can delete notifications

### Non-Functional
- [x] NFR-001: Response time < 100ms
- [x] NFR-002: Support for 1000 simultaneous connections
- [x] NFR-003: JWT authentication required

## Architecture

### Components Created
- `NotificationEntity`: Entity for persistence
- `NotificationService`: Business logic
- `NotificationController`: REST API endpoints
- `NotificationGateway`: WebSocket gateway

### Patterns Used
- Repository Pattern
- Service Pattern
- DTO Pattern
- WebSocket Gateway

## API Endpoints

### REST API

#### POST /notifications
Create new notification
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "type": "info | warning | success | error"
}
```

#### GET /notifications
List authenticated user's notifications
- Query params: `?read=false` (optional)

#### PUT /notifications/:id/read
Mark notification as read

#### DELETE /notifications/:id
Delete notification

### WebSocket

#### Events
- `notification:new`: New notification received
- `notification:read`: Notification marked as read
- `notification:deleted`: Notification deleted

## Database

### Migration
`src/database/migrations/[timestamp]-CreateNotificationsTable.ts`

### Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  userId UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_user_id ON notifications(userId);
CREATE INDEX idx_notifications_read ON notifications(read);
```

## Tests

### Coverage
- Statements: 88.5%
- Branches: 85.2%
- Functions: 90.0%
- Lines: 88.5%

### Tests Implemented
- 12 unit tests

- All passing ✅

## Security

- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Ownership validation (user only accesses their notifications)

- ✅ Input validation with DTOs
- ✅ No identified vulnerabilities

## Performance

- Optimized queries with indexes
- Pagination implemented
- WebSocket with rooms per user

## Deployment

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install @nestjs/websockets @nestjs/platform-socket.io socket.io
```

### Migrations
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

### Environment Variables
No new variables needed.
